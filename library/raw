options: {}
description: 
     - Executes a low-down and dirty SSH command, not going through the module
       subsystem. This is useful and should only be done in two cases. The
       first case is installing C(python-simplejson) on older (Python 2.4 and
       before) hosts that need it as a dependency to run modules, since nearly
       all core modules require it. Another is speaking to any devices such as
       routers that do not have any Python installed. In any other case, using
       the M(shell) or M(command) module is much more appropriate. Arguments
       given to M(raw) are run directly through the configured remote shell.
       Standard output, error output and return code are returned when
       available. There is no change handler support for this module.
     - This module does not require python on the remote system, much like
       the M(script) module.
examples:
    - description: Example from C(/usr/bin/ansible) to bootstrap a legacy python 2.4 host
      code: "action: raw yum -y install python-simplejson"
notes:
   -  If you want to execute a command securely and predictably, it may be
      better to use the M(command) module instead. Best practices when writing
      playbooks will follow the trend of using M(command) unless M(shell) is
      explicitly required. When running ad-hoc commands, use your best
      judgement.
