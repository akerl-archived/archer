     - The M(script) module takes the script name followed by a list of
       space-delimited arguments.
     - The given script will be processed through the shell environment.
     - This module does not require python on the remote system, much like
       the M(raw) module.
options:
  free_form:
    description:
      - path to the local script file followed by optional arguments.

examples:
  - description: "Example from Ansible Playbooks"
    code: "action: script /some/local/script.sh --some-arguments 1234"
notes:
  - It is preferable to write Ansible modules than pushing scripts. Convert your script to an Ansible module for bonus points!
